# Discrete Proper Time and a Tempo Field (Working Note)

This repository stores a working note.

## Abstract

This essay is a philosophical counterpart to the mathematical article archived at Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.17012407).
While the mathematical paper formalizes a discrete-time framework, the present text retranslates that framework into philosophical prose.
Retranslation here means a practice of slightly reconfiguring an existing framework in order to gain a new perspective.
